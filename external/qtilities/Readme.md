Introduction
------------

Qtilities is a set of Qt C++ libraries which provides building blocks for Qt applications, allowing rapid application development. The project consists of different modules which provide features which are common to a wide range of Qt applications, with the main goal of making common things easier to do.

Building & Getting Started
--------------------------

The following files in the repository's root folder will guide you through the process of building Qtilities:

* On Windows see "Building on Windows.txt"
* On Linux see "Building on Linux.txt"

Alternatively see http://www.qtilities.org/docs/master/page_getting_started.html. The documentation can be compiled by providing Doxygen with the /doc/doxyfile_website input file. On Windows you can run the /doc/win32_website.bat file directly if doxygen is in your path. Note that Doxygen versions prior to v1.7.4 generates garbage in some parts of the documentation.
